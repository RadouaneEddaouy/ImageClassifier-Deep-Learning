# Potato Leaf Disease Classification Model

## Overview

This project implements an image classification model using TensorFlow and the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm. The model is trained to classify potato leaves into three categories: healthy, early blight, and late blight. The classification is based on the features extracted from the images using convolutional layers.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a labeled dataset consisting of images of potato leaves affected by different diseases (early blight, late blight) as well as healthy potato leaves. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and test sets to train, validate, and evaluate the model's performance.

## Training

The model is trained using the training set with the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Input images are preprocessed to normalize pixel values, resize images, and apply data augmentation techniques (such as rotation, flipping, and scaling) to improve model generalization.

2. **Model Compilation:** The model is compiled with appropriate loss function, adam optimizer, and evaluation metrics.

3. **Training:** The compiled model is trained on the training set for a 50 epochs, adjusting the model weights to minimize the loss function.

4. **Validation:** Model performance is evaluated on the validation set after each epoch to monitor training progress and prevent overfitting.

## Evaluation

Once trained, the model's performance is evaluated using the test set to assess its accuracy and generalization ability on unseen potato leaf images.

## Deployment

The trained model can be deployed in various applications, including but not limited to:

- Integration into agricultural systems for automated detection and classification of potato leaf diseases.
- Deployment on mobile devices for real-time disease diagnosis in the field.
- Integration into web applications for remote consultation with agricultural experts.

## Future Improvements

Possible future improvements to enhance the model's performance and efficiency include:

- Collecting a larger and more diverse dataset of potato leaf images to improve model generalization.
- Experimenting with different CNN architectures and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
- Exploring techniques such as transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models for improved classification accuracy.
